                                                                     docker-swarm
                                                                  ================
what is docker swarm service ?

 * its collection of one or more containers same type(image/qapplication)




1. docker swarm-cluster
  ---------------------->*  its group of one (or)more masters rest of nodes

                         * TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications

                         * TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes

                         * UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

                         * ECP 50 overlay network with encrupition traffics allowed .

2. docker swarm-master
   --------------------:- # docker swarm init --advertise-add privateip-node -->(its create a manager) (or) ledar 

                          # docker swarm join-token manager -->(its genrate the manager token) this masters status was "rechable" , docker recamanded more then 7 master,

                          # docker swarm join-token worker -->(its genrate the worker token)  


3. managers server should be odd number
  -------------------------------------:-
                                         * (n-1)/2 ==> here n= number of server

                                         * EX--> n=2 --> (2-1)/2 its not work

                                         * EX--> n=3 --> (3-1)/2 its work 

4. docker net-works 
  -------------------:- * networks--> "ovrlay" is drive and its name of "docker-swarm" -->(its created by default when you apply the command of docker swarm init)

                        * if you created container in docker swarm that container under net-work of "docker-swarm"

                        
5. docker nodes ls
   ----------------:- * HERE
                        ----:-*	 status: ready--> its mean that node should be up and running .
                              
                              *  availability: active --> its mean node should be ready to run the containers. 

6. docker service
   ---------------:- in this  docker swarm-service we have two modes 1. Replica --> we dont menction replicas its take default 1/1

                                                                     2. global 

    # docker service create --name <name of container> -p  image-name 

                 * then its create continer any worker-node , you can acces out sidde any public ip of cluster like nodes ips or master ip .

    # docker service ls
 
                * its show the how many services running.
  
    # docker service ps conatiner-name

                * its give the details of container.

    # docker service scale conatiner-name=number of replicas

                * its create replicas in our cluster

    # docker service rm container-name

                * its delete the containers     

    # docker service create --name <name of container> --replicas 3 -p <> image-name

                 * its when create the container that time we create replicas how many you need.

globel-mode
------------:-
               * when we crete the service in global mode its going to copy the all cluster servers(masters and workers).

               * in this we dont use scale up and scale down               

    # docker service create --name <name of container> --mode globel -p <> image-name
