                                                             nat-gateway
                                                           ==============

1.PUBLIC-SUBNET
  --------------:- in this subnetes rout the direct to IGW its called pulic-subnet, like routing table direct connection the IGW

2.PRIVATE-SUBNET
  ---------------:-  any subnet which is not rout the directly to the IGW  its called private subnet.


3. # ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@private subnet ip

   here
  ------:- 1. those 2 subnets in same VPC
           2. key.pem => public subnet key



how to connect whith out pem-key instance
------------------------------------------:- 

* creat the iam-role in ec2 permission of ssmf full access ,and ssmmanagedinstanceCore finish this work atteched the instance.

* after some time 

* goto management & governance ==> here system Manager clik it then goto session manager clik it goto start sesion 
           

NAT-GATEWAY
------------:- * network address trenselation 

               * its only one job thats whatever trafic come to private subnets its conveted to public ip and send through igw.

               * traffic send only inside to outside its work , but out side to inside its not work.

create Nat-gateway
-------------------:- * we deploy the nat-gate that time we attched the public-subnet, (because traffic sends this subnet) and also elastic-ip

                      * here elastic-ip was mandatory nate-gate because its reboot tahts why.           
 
                      * after do this work, goto private subnet rout-table here to attched the rout to nat-gat


Vpc- ENDPOINTS
---------------:- * its private-subnet  dont use the nat-gate how to download something like S3 files, we use VPC-ENDPOINTS.

                  * VPC-ENDPOINTS its having private conectvity to different services.


* Emdpoints:- create endpoints click goto here chose the  S3 storage---> gateway  select them.

* then attech the vpc and private-ssubnet rout . after some time to check the rout-table its automatically genreted routing.  

* its gate-way thats why its  automatically genreted routing.

* then goto that instance and check the S3 connection like :- # wget url of s3-bucket file (or) # aws s3 ls
