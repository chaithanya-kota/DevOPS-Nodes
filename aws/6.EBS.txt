                                                     ==========================
Instace store:
-------------:-
* its temorary storage, data will be lost when you stop and start the server.

* the size is fixed.

* you cannot detech and assign to a different server.

* we cannot chose type of driver for IS , default will be SSD.

EBS VOLUME
------------:-
* its a persistant storage.

* you can increase in untill 16TB but cannot decrece it.

* we can detach and assign to the different server, but EBS or IS can be assinged to single server at any point.

* we can chose between SSD and HDD . 


#lsblk  (its show the storage of disks in missions)

# cat /etc/fstab (its show the mounts in instances)

# df -h

how to create and attech the volume
====================================:-

* here we create instance that time we chose the volume.

* goto instance  "# lsblk"  this command to show the disks

* in this disk we store some data (or) applications.

* # cat /etc/fstab (its importent "fstab" volume disk palced inside the fstab because restart instance that mount its connected )

Atteched (or) assined EBS volume
---------------------------------:-

* goto --> EBS volumes --> volumes--> create volume .

* here give the volume details like availabilty zone, same of your instance then only its work.

* after finish work that volume is redy then atteched the instance.

* then goto instace check disks,

* # lsblk     here--> show the new volume disk.

* that volume is only disk its not ready to use  what we do,

* we do 3steps to formet to this disk to mount volume  1step ==> disk -to- formet disk  2step ==> formet disk-to- file system 3step==>file system -to- mount

* step1
  -----:- # fdsik /dev/xvdf 

          * then enter the "M"
          * next enter  "N"  (its new portition)  
          * next enter four times
          * next enter "w" (its save)

HERE
-----:- fdsik /dev/xvdf  fdsik--> formet disk  dev/xvdf--> path and file-name

then check the disks use # lsblk   --> here new pertitons added .

2STEP
-----:- # mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1 

        * here ---> xvdf1 its partitons.

3step
-----:- # mkdir /krishvol

       * chek # du -h /krishvol

       * here check # lsblk --> krishvol not mount

       * # mount /dev/xvdf1/krishvol/

       * # lsblk --> its show them.
       
after finish 3 steps
---------------------:- * store the some data in this volume , and restart the instance, that mount is gone,  why 

                        "because that volume not in fstab"
                                                    ------
                         *  # nano /etc/fstab
 
                         * here we give the details of our volume like  /dev/xvdf1    /krishvol  copy the above label paste here

how to volume increase in EBS
------------------------------:-

step1
------: goto aws ebs volumes select our volume and increse them somthing like 15gb

step2
-----: goto ec2 mission # lsblk --> disk -15gb, but partitons -->10gb what we do

      * # growpart /dev/xvdf 1

      * # lsblk --> now its shows the 15gb partions


                                                               ======(or)======



1.how to increase volume in ec2?

* go to AWS increase volume size

   come to our ec2-server # df -h

   its dosent update,

   # resize2fs name of disk

   # reboot instance

   # df -h
