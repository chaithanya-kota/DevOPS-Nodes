                                                      =================
1. Array
  -------> its group of memory location where we can store the values.
            
           * once we create array we store the any values.
  
           * what is the diffrence b/w the added array in read variable command.--> only read variable command only take one variable value
       
              BUT here array its take number of variable values.

           * array----> start--->0 1 2 3 4 5 6 (values) here total numbers= 7
